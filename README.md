<h1>Day 7 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</h1>
<p>For the Day 7 challenge, I created a Hangman game, where a random word is chosen from a word list and players (with a limited number of lives) have to try to guess the word. This is a culmination of the teaching points that were shared in the tutorial, including the following but not limited to</p>
<ul>
  <li>creation of a flow chart </li>
  <li>while and for loop</li>
  <li>if, else and elif statements</li>
  <li>input, import and print function</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
<p>I have learned python before in school but I hope to revisit some of the python concepts that I may have forgotten and at the same time delve further into python, especially in the field of data science and visualisation.</p>

<h2>You can join me too!</h2>
